# Burger App
This app allows a user to enter in a burger that his/her would like to eat.  When a user submits a burger, that burger is
displayed on the left side of the page.  Each burger displayed has a button called "devour-it" that, when clicked, will move
that burger to the right side of the page.  The app stores every burger wether devoured or not within a mysql database.
